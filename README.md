# Threat Protection Software

This project is a threat protection software developed in Python that provides real-time monitoring and analysis of network traffic to detect and mitigate security threats. It implements features such as intrusion detection, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence integration.

## Features

- **Capture Network Traffic**: Utilizes Scapy library to capture network packets.
- **Intrusion Detection**: Implements basic intrusion detection using regular expressions to detect known attack patterns.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implements anomaly detection using scikit-learn's Isolation Forest algorithm.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Integrates with external threat intelligence APIs to identify known malicious IP addresses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amitrajputfff/Network-Threat-Protection.git
  
2. Change the Directory :

    ```bash
    cd Network-Threat-Protection
    
4. Install Dependencies :

    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the desired Python script to execute specific functionalities (e.g., capture_traffic.py, intrusion_detection.py, etc.).
2. Follow the on-screen instructions or review the code comments to understand each script's functionality.
3. Customize and extend the code as needed for your specific use case.
